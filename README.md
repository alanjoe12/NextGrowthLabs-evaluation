#  Model Deployment
I used pickle file for the models and developed a webpage with html and backend we used flask python framework then host it in Heroku.

## More Bonus points
##### 1. Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us difficult - is something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a similarly good solution). 
My feel difficult on regex problem from the dictionary extract integer is little bit difficult for me. On Hotel Check-In prediction i dont feel any difficult

##### 2. Explain back propagation and tell us how you handle a dataset if 4 out of 30 parameters have null values more than 40 percentage
##### Back propagation
Backpropagation is an algorithm used in artificial neural network to fine-tune mathematical weight functions and improve the accuracy of an artificial neural network's outputs.
##### how you handle a dataset if 4 out of 30 parameters have null values more than 40 percentage
if there is more than 70-75% of missing values percentage null values then we can drope the raw , and  more than 40 % null values we can do imputaion methods like replace null values with mean, mode, medium. then replace with unique category like this we can do.
